<h4>Project Overview and Architecture:-</h4>
 <p>The Job Application Tracker + Analytics Dashboard (Mini ATS) is a MERN stack project that helps recruiters manage and analyze job applications. It features a Kanban board (Applied → Interview → Offer → Rejected) with drag-and-drop, forms for adding applications. An analytics dashboard shows stage-wise counts, role breakdowns, and average experience using dynamic charts. The frontend (React/Next.js + Tailwind/Material UI) handles UI and API calls, the backend (Node.js + Express) provides CRUD and analytics endpoints, and the database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) stores applications with aggregation for insights.</p>
